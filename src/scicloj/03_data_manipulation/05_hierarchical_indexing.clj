["# Hierarchical Indexing"]

["Up to this point we've been focused primarily on one-dimensional and
two-dimensional data, stored in Pandas Series and DataFrame objects,
respectively. Often it is useful to go beyond this and store higher-dimensional
dataâ€“that is, data indexed by more than one or two keys. While Pandas does
provide Panel and Panel4D objects that natively handle three-dimensional and
four-dimensional data (see Aside: Panel Data), a far more common pattern in
practice is to make use of hierarchical indexing (also known as multi-indexing)
to incorporate multiple index levels within a single index. In this way,
higher-dimensional data can be compactly represented within the familiar
one-dimensional Series and two-dimensional DataFrame objects."]

["In this section, we'll explore the direct creation of MultiIndex objects,
considerations when indexing, slicing, and computing statistics across multiply
indexed data, and useful routines for converting between simple and
hierarchically indexed representations of your data."]

["We begin with the standard imports:"]

(require '[tablecloth.api :as tablecloth])

["## A Multiply Indexed Series"]

["Let's start by considering how we might represent two-dimensional data within
a one-dimensional Series. For concreteness, we will consider a series of data
where each point has a character and numerical key."]

["### The bad way"]

["Suppose you would like to track data about states from two different
years. Using the Pandas tools we've already covered, you might be tempted to
simply use Python tuples as keys:"]

(def index [["California", 2000], ["California", 2010],
            ["New York", 2000], ["New York", 2010],
            ["Texas", 2000], ["Texas", 2010]])
