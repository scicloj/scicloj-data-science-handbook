# Introduction to data-science-handbook
SciCloj is the Clojure data science community that is developing a series of jupyter style notebooks to demonstrate how to achieve specific data science tasks using the Clojure programming languages.

[scicloj/notespace project](https://github.com/scicloj/notespace) is used to develop each notebook by rendering a Clojure namespace.  Each Clojure top-level form in a namespace is a note in the notebook and can be tagged a specific kind (type of note).

## Static notebooks
Static notebooks are generated by notespace from each Clojure namespace to create a separate chapter for the handbook
