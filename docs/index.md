SciCloj is the Clojure data science community that is developing a series of jupyter style notebooks to demonstrate how to achieve specific data science tasks using the Clojure programming languages.

[scicloj/notespace project](https://github.com/scicloj/notespace) is used to develop each notebook by rendering a Clojure namespace.  Each Clojure top-level form in a namespace is a note in the notebook and can be tagged a specific kind (type of note).

### Contributing examples
The [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) is a source of inspiration for the project.  Choose a chapter or sub-chapter in this book and consider how you would do similar tasks using Clojure and the wide range of libraries it has.

Each chapter or sub-chapter has its own namespace, so review the [`src/scicloj` directory](https://github.com/scicloj/scicloj-data-science-handbook/tree/live/src/scicloj) to see which chapters are already started.

Use the [Clojurians Zulip #ml-study stream](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/264992-ml-study) to discuss chapters you wish to work on and get help with Clojure and its libraries.

See the [getting started section](getting-started.md)


## Static notebooks
Static notebooks are generated by notespace from each Clojure namespace to create a separate chapter for the handbook
