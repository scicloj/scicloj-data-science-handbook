While it serves this purpose very well, its limitations become clear when\\nwe need more flexibility (e.g., attaching labels to data, working with missing\\ndata, etc.) and when attempting operations that do not map well to element-wise\\nbroadcasting (e.g., groupings, pivots, etc.), each of which is an important\\npiece of analyzing the less structured data available in many forms in the world\\naround us. Pandas, and in particular its Series and DataFrame objects, builds on\\nthe NumPy array structure and provides efficient access to these sorts of \\\"data\\nmunging\\\" tasks that occupy much of a data scientist's time.\\n\\nIn this chapter, we will focus on the mechanics of using Series, DataFrame, and\\nrelated structures effectively. We will use examples drawn from real datasets\\nwhere appropriate, but these examples are not necessarily the focus.\"]]], \"245\" [:div nil [:div [:p/markdown \"As you read through this chapter, don't forget that clojure and cider gives\\nyou the ability to quickly explore the contents of a namespace (by using the\\ntab-completion feature) as well as the documentation of various functions (using\\n`doc` and `find-doc`).\"]]], \"131\" [:div nil [:div [:p/markdown \"And to display tablecloth's built-in documentation, you can use this:\\n\\n`(clojure.repl/doc tablecloth.api)`\"]]], \"103\" [:div nil [:div [:p {:style {:font-style \"italic\", :font-family \"\\\"Lucida Console\\\", Courier, monospace\"}} [:small \"(not evaluated yet)\"]]]], \"248\" [:div [:p/code {:code \"(clojure.repl/doc tablecloth.api)\", :bg-class \"bg-light\"}] [:div [:p/code {:code \"nil\\n\"}]]], \"285\" [:div nil [:div [:p/markdown \"As you read through this chapter, don't forget that clojure and cider gives\\nyou the ability to quickly explore the contents of a namespace (by using the\\ntab-completion feature) as well as the documentation of various functions (using\\n`doc` and `find-doc`).\"]]], \"41\" [:div nil [:div [:p/markdown \"## Installing and Using tablecloth\"]]], \"91\" [:div nil [:div [:p {:style {:font-style \"italic\", :font-family \"\\\"Lucida Console\\\", Courier, monospace\"}} [:small \"(not evaluated yet)\"]]]], \"10\" [:div nil [:div nil]], \"65\" [:div nil [:div [:p/markdown \"Once Pandas is installed, you can import it and check the version:\"]]], \"291\" [:div nil [:div [:p/markdown \"And to display tablecloth's built-in documentation, you can use this:\\n\\n`(clojure.repl/doc tablecloth.api)`\"]]], \"330\" [:div [:p/code {:code \"(require 'tablecloth.api)\", :bg-class \"bg-light\"}] [:div [:p/code {:code \"nil\\n\"}]]], \"40\" [:div nil [:div [:p/markdown \"## Installing and Using tablecloth\"]]], \"161\" [:div nil [:div nil]], \"230\" [:div [:p/code {:code \"(clojure.repl/doc tablecloth/column-names)\", :bg-class \"bg-light\"}] [:div [:p/code {:code \"nil\\n\"}]]], \"242\" [:div [:p/code {:code \"(require '[tablecloth.api :as tablecloth])\", :bg-class \"bg-light\"}] [:div [:p/code {:code \"nil\\n\"}]]], \"129\" [:div nil [:div [:p/markdown \"More detailed documentation, along with tutorials and other resources, can be\\nfound at https://scicloj.github.io/tablecloth/index.html.\"]]], \"187\" [:div nil [:div [:p/markdown \"This require convention will be used throughout the remainder of this book.\"]]], \"214\" [:div nil [:div [:p/markdown \"More detailed documentation, along with tutorials and other resources, can be\\nfound at https://scicloj.github.io/tablecloth/index.html.\"]]], \"31\" [:div nil [:div [:p/markdown \"# Data Manipulation with Pandas\"]]], \"71\" [:div [:p/code {:code \"(require '[tablecloth.api :as tablecloth])\", :bg-class \"bg-light\"}] [:div [:p/code {:code \"nil\\n\"}]]], \"164\" [:div nil [:div [:p/markdown \"# Data Manipulation with Pandas\"]]], \"361\" [:div nil [:div [:p/markdown \"More detailed documentation, along with tutorials and other resources, can be\\nfound at https://scicloj.github.io/tablecloth/index.html.\"]]], \"163\" [:div nil [:div [:p/markdown \"# Data Manipulation with Pandas\"]]], \"349\" [:div nil [:div [:p/markdown \"And to display tablecloth's built-in documentation, you can use this:\\n\\n`(clojure.repl/doc tablecloth.api)`\"]]], \"323\" [:div nil [:div [:p/markdown \"Installation of Pandas on your system requires NumPy to be installed, and if\\nbuilding the library from source, requires the appropriate tools to compile the\\nC and Cython sources on which Pandas is built.
